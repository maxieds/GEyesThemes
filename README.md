# GEyesThemes

Custom themes for the Gnome panel applet GEyes. Note that the source to 
*GEyes* is available on [github](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-applets), 
and also on the official Gnome git site 
[here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-applets). 
Documentation for the *GEyes* panel applet can be found 
[here](https://help.gnome.org/users/geyes/3.5/).
A hacking manual detailing how to modify and/or create new themes for 
*GEyes* is available [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-applets/blob/master/geyes/README.themes).

## Installation

Typically, the themes can be installed by copying the individual theme 
directories into the appropriate themes directory under **/usr/share**.
First, clone our repository by running:
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/maxieds/GEyesThemes.git
$ cd GEyesThemes
```
On Linux Mint (*MATE* desktop), and likely on modern Ubuntu derivatives, 
this can be accomplished by executing:
```
$ sudo cp -r ./* /usr/share/mate-applets/geyes/
```
Then if you right click on the installed *GEyes* applet in your Gnome panel, 
and select *Preferences*, you should immediately be able to select eye 
styles from among the newly installed themes.

## The custom themes

### Green/Pink/Brown-EyedGirl themes

As an avid female user of Linux and Gnome who always has GEyes open on my panel, it has always annoyed me that the only semi-custom, non-monster theme looks like a blue-eyed male (which is fine, just not on my desktop). I decided to create a few custom female eyes in green, pink, and brown for the ladies who use Gnome on their choice of Linux.

### PumpkinMonster theme

In honor of the [Smashing Pumpkins concert](https://twitter.com/i/events/1029828145145307136) 
broadcast live on the day of its inception, I offer the *PumpkinMonster* 
eye set as a Halloween-themed tribute to the band.
