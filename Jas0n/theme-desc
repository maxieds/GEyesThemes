There once was a superiorly rated lecturer in computer science who despite 
tactical skills in illuminating us all with diagrams of trees was not a 
particularly articulate genius with a swolen ego -- as the type goes. 
Also, not being a native penguin himself (a well demonstrated, and 
spectacularly illustrated fact on his Google groups), 
I felt the need to go all hexadecimal on the spelling of his name when 
addressing the man over email. My custom compiled, flawless exotic-arch 
desktop for the time was subsequently hacked by means of me naively 
logging into a school machine with XFormwarding and "-Y". I surmise that the 
hexadecimal notation, with which he surely must have been familiar, though 
never discussed in *his* classes, pissed it off. I am a more mature and 
thoughtful being these days, so to express that all is forgiven for his 
past asshole tendencies and inadquate nature, I have crafted this theme to 
welcome him home to Linux in the event he ever decides to go PC. 
After all numerical pronunciations of non-technical vernacular are one of the 
highest forms of flattery that can be issued at a public figure -- and he 
most certainly one of the Uber-most of them all.
